					 In the film <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope">Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope</a>  (1977), Han Solo and his Wookiee co-pilot, Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), become involved in the Rebel Alliance against the Galactic Empire. Over the course of the Star Wars franchise, Solo becomes a chief figure in the Alliance and succeeding galactic governments. Star Wars creator George Lucas described Solo as "a loner who realizes the importance of being part of a group and helping for the common good".[1] Han remains one of cinema's most revered movie characters.
